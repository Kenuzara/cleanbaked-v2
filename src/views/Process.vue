    <h2>How It Gets Done</h2>
    <p class="lead">My Process to Building a Site</p>

    <h4>Discovery</h4>
    <p>
      Every project should begin with a discovery phase. The objective is to
      learn about a project, specifically, its requirements and goals. By
      obtaining this knowledge and combining it with a study on the client's
      market and competition a strong, objective focused design can be crafted.

    <blockquote>Iteration is a cornerstone of impactful design.</blockquote>

    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>
      In discovering what a clients needs and wants out of their site, much of
      the design legwork is already done. Taking that knowledge, a layout
      focused on delivering results can be formed. Iteration is a cornerstone of
      impactful design. With this in mind, I like to start on paper putting out
      as many ideas as I can following the general guidelines of the project. I
      take the best 1 or 2 ideas into Photoshop or straight into the browser,
      whichever is more efficient for the project at hand.
    </p>

    <h4>Build</h4>
    <p>
      Once I have a mockup or draft site that the client is pleased with, the
      design is layered onto a CMS. Utilizing the latest techniques such as
      responsive design helps ensure that a client's site is compatible with as
      many devices as possible and the major browsers.
    </p>

    <h4>Launch & Evaluation</h4>
    <p>
      Once a site is built to a client's satisfaction and is ensured to deliver
      the best experience on as many devices and browsers as possible, the site
      goes live! But as any web professional will attest, this is truly only the
      beginning of a site's life. Using analysis and evaluation once a site has
      launched, pages can be tweaked to improve search results and user
      engagement.
